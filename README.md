# Dementia Prevalence Analysis | NHS England (Power BI)

**Tools:** Power BI, DAX, Data Modelling, Data Visualization, Healthcare Analytics  

---
## Project Overview
This project analyses dementia prevalence across **NHS England** to identify **demographic, geographic, and care-setting inequalities**. Using official NHS primary care data, the dashboard explores variation by **age, sex, ethnicity, residential care status, NHS regions, and Integrated Care Boards (ICBs)**.

The aim is to transform complex healthcare data into **actionable insights** that support **targeted service planning, equitable resource allocation, and evidence-based policy development**.
